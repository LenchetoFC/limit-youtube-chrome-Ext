The single most important part of your portfolio project is the README.md found at the root of your project (GitHub will render it automatically on your repo page if it exists). It's the first thing that hiring managers will see when they click through to your project.

In many cases, hiring managers won't even take the time to look at your code, let alone clone and run it. The README.md is your chance to "wow" them and convince them that you're worth their time.

## SECTIONS OF A GOOD README
A good README.md has a few sections:

# YouTube Algorithm Regulator
## Description
"Why?" (Motivation/Goal/Problem to solve)
Quick Start
Usage
Contributing
We will look at each of these in detail, but for now, let's just get a good title.

TITLE SECTION
Give your project a good name! Don't name it "project", "API server", or "test app". Give it a name that's unique and memorable. Personality is useful here.

MARKDOWN FORMATTING
Use this Markdown Reference to help you format your README. Your title should be an H1 (heading 1, the largest heading). You should then use H2s and H3s to organize the rest of your README into a nice hierarchy.

Submit the link to your project's GitHub repo after you've added a title using an H1 heading.
